## 前言
蠻酷的，這們課用go 上課，lab 也是用go去寫
Prof: We could use other system-style lang e.g. java, C++ ... 
Reason: 
- Provides bunch of convenient features good support for thread, locking, synchronization
- Convenient RPC library, c++ hard to one easy to use library
- Type safe, mem safe unlike c++
- GC -> Combination of thread and mem keeping is important and hard
- "Simple", straight-forward
## Threads
### Reasons to use threads
- I/O Concurrency 
- Parallelism
- Convenience
  Do sth periodically
### Challenges programming in threads
- Race Condition -> Lock 
	- Why not implement lock in data structure(internally)?
		- Programmers may not need lock for every scenario, and might not want to pay for the overhead of lock
		- If 2 data structure both have lock internally and uses each other, they may create deadlock
- Coordination
	- Channel
	- sync.cond
	- wait group
- Deadlock
